## About
This project was inspired by my passion for rap music and one of [the Wes Bos courses][wes].
The whole code is written with the use features of ES6.

### How to use
The sound is played when you click proper key on the keyboard. Every key you can use is marked by the letter at the button.
On mobile devices, you simply touch the chosen button to play.

### What's next
I still think about a little upgrade. I want to add the possibility to change sound samples by the user with a usage
of Drag and Drop API and maybe some other stuff that will make my app more like the AKAI MPC.

### There's my GitHub page with [working project][mpc].
